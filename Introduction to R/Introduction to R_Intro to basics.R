#How it works

#In the editor on the right there is already some sample code. Can you see which lines are actual R code and which are comments?
#Add a line of code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, and hit the 'Submit Answer' button.

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12

#Type 2^5 in the editor to calculate 2 to the power 5.
#Type 28 %% 6 to calculate 28 modulo 6.
#Submit the answer and have a look at the R output in the console.
#Note how the # symbol is used to add comments on the R code.

# An addition
5 + 5 

# A subtraction
5 - 5 

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28 %% 6

#Over to you: complete the code in the editor such that it assigns the value 42 to the variable x in the editor. Submit the answer. Notice that when you ask R to print x, the value 42 appears.

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x

#Type the following code in the editor: my_apples <- 5. This will assign the value 5 to my_apples.
#Type: my_apples below the second comment. This will print out the value of my_apples.
#Submit your answer, and look at the output: you see that the number 5 is printed. So R now links the variable my_apples to the value 5.

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples

#Assign to my_oranges the value 6.
#Add the variables my_apples and my_oranges and have R simply print the result.
#Assign the result of adding my_apples and my_oranges to a new variable my_fruit.

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_fruit <- my_apples+my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit

#Submit the answer and read the error message. Make sure to understand why this did not work.
#Adjust the code so that R knows you have 6 oranges and thus a fruit basket with 11 pieces of fruit.

# Assign a value to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5 

# Fix the assignment of my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6 

# Create the variable my_fruit and print it out
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit

#Change the value of the:
#
#my_numeric variable to 42.
#my_character variable to "universe". Note that the quotation marks indicate that "universe" is a character.
#my_logical variable to FALSE.
#Note that R is case sensitive!

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE

#Complete the code in the editor and also print out the classes of my_character and my_logical.

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
